<h1>Telco Customer Churn Prediction</h1>

<p>This repository contains the source code for predicting customer churn in a telecommunications company.</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can identify customers who are likely to churn from the telco company. The project includes exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, feature selection, and model benchmarking.</p>

<h2>Repository Structure</h2>

<p>Here is a brief explanation of what each part of this repository covers:</p>
